# Homebrew-PHP55

PHP 5.5 formulae micro-repo

## Why?

This repo came natural after the [PHP 5.4](https://github.com/tzvetkoff/homebrew-php54) one.

For the moment, the repository does not contain any PHP extensions - they can be easily installed with `phpize` and then manually added to `php.ini` or `/usr/local/etc/php.ini.d/EXTENSION_NAME.ini`.

## How to install?

Open your favorite terminal and type:

``` bash
brew tap tzvetkoff/php55
brew install php
```

## List of formulae
`php`
`phpsh`
